# Lab results

A small web app using Node.js and React/TS/Vite.

Setup:

1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`

1. Start server:
   `npm run start:server`

(The server will set up the mock database from an init file on start. All further changes will be saved to the mock database.)

2. Run `npm run dev` to start the client.
